In ReactJS, props and state are two key concepts that are essential for building dynamic and interactive components. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation with examples for each:

 Props
Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from one component to another. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the component receiving them.

#### Example: Using Props
1. Parent Component (App.js):
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="John" />
      <Greeting name="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Child Component (Greeting.js):
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

In this example, the `App` component passes the `name` prop to the `Greeting` component. The `Greeting` component then uses this prop to display a personalized greeting.

 State
State is a built-in object used to hold data or information about the component. Unlike props, the state is managed within the component and can be changed over time. When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect these changes.

Example: Using State
1. Component with State (Counter.js):
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the `Counter` component uses the `useState` hook to create a `count` state variable. The `setCount` function is used to update the state. When the button is clicked, the `setCount` function increments the `count` state, causing the component to re-render and display the updated count.

 Combining Props and State
You can combine props and state to create more dynamic and interactive components.

 Example: Combining Props and State
1. Parent Component (App.js):
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import GreetingWithCounter from './GreetingWithCounter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <GreetingWithCounter name="John" />
      <GreetingWithCounter name="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Child Component with State (GreetingWithCounter.js):
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function GreetingWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default GreetingWithCounter;
```

In this example, the `GreetingWithCounter` component receives the `name` prop and also maintains its own state (`count`). This allows the component to both display a personalized greeting (using props) and manage its own click counter (using state).

 Summary
-Props: Used to pass data from parent to child components. Immutable and read-only.
-State: Managed within the component. Mutable and can change over time, causing the component to re-render.

Using props and state effectively allows you to create dynamic, reusable, and interactive React components.
