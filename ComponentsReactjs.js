ReactJS components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be managed separately. There are two main types of components in React: 
Functional Components and Class Components.

Functional Components

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX (React's syntax extension for HTML). They are commonly used for their simplicity and ease of use. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can now handle state and side effects.

 Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyFunctionalComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyFunctionalComponent;
```

Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They are more feature-rich and used to be the only way to handle state and lifecycle methods before hooks were introduced.

Example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyClassComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyClassComponent;
```

 Types of Components

1. Presentational (Stateless) Components: These components are primarily concerned with how things look. They receive data and callbacks exclusively via props and do not manage state.

    ```jsx
    function PresentationalComponent({ title }) {
      return <h1>{title}</h1>;
    }
    ```

2. Container (Stateful) Components: These components manage state and handle logic. They may pass down state and functions as props to presentational components.

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import PresentationalComponent from './PresentationalComponent';

    function ContainerComponent() {
      const [title, setTitle] = useState('Hello, World!');

      return <PresentationalComponent title={title} />;
    }
    ```

 Component Composition

React components can be composed together to create more complex UIs. This involves nesting components within each other.
 Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
  return <h1>Header</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
  return <footer>Footer</footer>;
}

function Main() {
  return <p>Main Content</p>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

 Lifecycle Methods

Class components provide lifecycle methods that allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's life. Common lifecycle methods include:

- `componentDidMount()`: Executed after the component is mounted.
- `componentDidUpdate()`: Executed after the component updates.
- `componentWillUnmount()`: Executed before the component is unmounted and destroyed.

 Hooks in Functional Components

React Hooks allow functional components to have state and side effects. Some commonly used hooks include:

- `useState()`: Allows you to add state to a functional component.
- `useEffect()`: Allows you to perform side effects in a functional component.
- `useContext()`: Allows you to access context in a functional component.

 Example with Hooks

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FunctionalComponentWithHooks() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulating a data fetch
    setTimeout(() => {
      setData('Hello, React Hooks!');
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}

export default FunctionalComponentWithHooks;
```

Conclusion

React components are versatile and can be used to build complex UIs in a manageable way. Whether using functional components with hooks or class components with lifecycle methods, React provides a powerful and flexible framework for building modern web applications.
